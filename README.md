# Tutorial-ISWC2019-LDflex-on-React
This tutorial is inspired by the [Solid profile viewer in React](https://github.com/solid/profile-viewer-react/)
but this time built with the [React LDflex components](https://github.com/solid/react-components#create-data-expressions-with-ldflex).

**Follow the tutorial walkthrough on our [wiki]().**

Most of these files are autogenerated
by [React Create App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The actual code is in:

Compare this to the original profile viewer:
